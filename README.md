# angular-bootstrap-demo
Angular with Bootstrap 


Let’s start by installing the latest version of Angular CLI. In your terminal, run the following command:

npm install -g @angular/cli

Creating A Project
Once you have Angular CLI installed, let’s use it to generate an Angular 7 project by running the following command:

ng new angular-bootstrap-demo

Adding Bootstrap

After creating the project, you need to install Bootstrap 4 and integrate it with your Angular project.

First, navigate inside your project’s root folder:

 cd angular-bootstrap-demo
 
 
 
 Next, install Bootstrap 4 and jQuery from npm:

 npm install --save bootstrap jquery
Copy
(In this case, bootstrap v4.2.1 and jquery v3.3.1 are installed.)
